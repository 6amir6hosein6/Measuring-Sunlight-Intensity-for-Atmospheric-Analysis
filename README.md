# Measuring Sunlight Intensity for Atmospheric Analysis
The sun emits a vast amount of light that can be harnessed for a variety of purposes, including measuring and analyzing atmospheric conditions. By measuring the intensity of sunlight, researchers and professionals can obtain valuable data about the presence of dust and polluting particles in the air.

The image is cropped to a specific area of interest using OpenCV. This process involves creating a mask on the desired region and applying it to the original image. By doing so, we can eliminate unwanted elements and focus our analysis on the specific important area which the result is this:

Next, we utilize OpenCV and Mathplotlib to obtain the brightness values of each point in the cropped image and plot them on a graph. This analysis provides valuable insights into the specific region of interest and can be used to detect trends and patterns in the data. Furthermore, the data can be fed into a CNN for prediction modeling, allowing for early detection and prevention of air pollution. By leveraging the power of image processing and machine learning techniques, we can work towards creating a cleaner and healthier environment for all.
